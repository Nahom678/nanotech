    <P>➢ Agriculture (Green Biotechnology): Biotechnology had contributed a lot to modify the
        genes of the organism known as Genetically Modified Organisms such as Crops,
        Animals, Plants, Fungi, Bacteria, etc. Genetically modified crops are formed by the
        manipulation of DNA to introduce a new trait into the crops. These manipulations are done
        to introduce traits such as pest resistance, insect resistance, weed resistance, etc.
        ➢ Medicine (Medicinal Biotechnology): This helps in the formation of genetically modified
        insulin known as humulin. This helps in the treatment of a large number of diabetes
        patients. It has also given rise to a technique known as gene therapy. Gene therapy is a
        technique to remove the genetic defect in an embryo or child. This technique involves the
        transfer of a normal gene that works over the non-functional gene.
        ➢ Aquaculture Fisheries: It helps in improving the quality and quantity of fishes. Through
        biotechnology, fishes are induced to breed via gonadotropin-releasing hormone.
        ➢ Environment (Environmental biotechnology): is used in waste treatment and pollution
        prevention. Environmental biotechnology can more efficiently clean up many wastes than
        conventional methods and greatly reduce our dependence on methods for land-based
        disposal. Every organism ingests nutrients to live and produces by-products as a result.
        Different organisms need different types of nutrients. Some bacteria thrive on the chemical
        components of waste products. Environmental engineers use bioremediation, the broadest
        application of environmental biotechnology, in two basic ways. They introduce nutrients
        to stimulate the activity of bacteria already present in the soil at a waste site or add new
        bacteria to the soil. The bacteria digest the waste at the site and turn it into harmless
        byproducts. After the bacteria consume the waste materials, they die off or return to their
        normal population levels in the environment.
