   <P> ➢ Medicine: customized nanoparticles the size of molecules that can deliver drugs directly to
    diseased cells in your body. When it's perfected, this method should greatly reduce the
    damage treatment such as chemotherapy does to a patient's healthy cells.
    ➢ Electronics: it has some answers for how we might increase the capabilities of electronics
    devices while we reduce their weight and power consumption.
    ➢ Food: it has an impact on several aspects of food science, from how food is grown to how
    it is packaged. Companies are developing nanomaterials that will make a difference not
    only in the taste of food but also in food safety and the health benefits that food delivery.
    ➢ Agriculture: nanotechnology can possibly change the whole agriculture part and
    nourishment industry anchor from generation to preservation, handling, bundling,
    transportation, and even waste treatment.
    ➢ Vehicle manufacturers: Much like aviation, lighter and stronger materials will be
    valuable for making vehicles that are both quicker and more secure. Burning motors will
    likewise profit from parts that are all the more hardwearing and higher temperature safe.</P>
